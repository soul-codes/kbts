# kbts - a documentation-as-code library for TypeScript

> ℹ️ This package is in early development phase!



`kbts` (for "Knowledge Base in TypeScript") presents a
documentation-as-code solution where units of documentation
("knowledge base" or "KB") are composed programmatically
to generate documentation. The approach in principle
allows for different presentations of KBs in various media
(markdown, CLI, interactive web page, etc); generally, `kbts`
encourages knowledge to be authored and linked independently of how it
is presented.
